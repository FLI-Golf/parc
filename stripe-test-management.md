# Stripe Test Data Management

## Current Stripe Test Environment Status

### 🔍 Check Your Test Transactions

**Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

**What you'll see:**
- ✅ **Succeeded**: Completed test payments (these are fine)
- ⏳ **Requires Capture**: Authorized but not captured (will auto-expire)
- ❌ **Failed**: Failed test attempts (safe to ignore)

### 🧹 No "Reset" Required

**Unlike your database, Stripe test mode doesn't need cleanup because:**

1. **Test transactions are isolated** - don't affect anything real
2. **No financial impact** - all simulated
3. **Unlimited test transactions** - no quotas or limits
4. **Auto-expiring** - authorized payments expire in 7 days
5. **Independent records** - old tests don't interfere with new ones

### ⚠️ Potential Issues After Database Cleanup

**Problem**: Payment intents in Stripe but no database records

**What happens:**
- Stripe: "Payment intent pi_xyz exists and is authorized"
- Database: "No ticket/order found for pi_xyz"
- Result: Recovery system handles this gracefully

**Our recovery system handles this:**
```javascript
// If no matching tickets found for payment intent
if (matchingTickets.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No active tickets found to match this payment');
}
```

## 🔄 Fresh Testing Strategy

### Option 1: Continue with Existing Stripe Data
**Recommended** - Just continue testing:
- Old test transactions stay in Stripe (harmless)
- New tests work normally
- Recovery system handles orphaned payment intents

### Option 2: Fresh Stripe Test Environment
If you want a completely clean Stripe environment:

1. **Create new Stripe test keys**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - **Regenerate keys** (creates fresh environment)
   - **Update your .env** with new keys

2. **Or use Stripe's "Clear Test Data" (if available)**:
   - Some Stripe accounts have this feature
   - Clears all test transactions
   - Rarely needed for development

### Option 3: Use Different Test Account
- Create separate Stripe account for testing
- Use different API keys
- Completely isolated environment

## 🧪 Testing Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow
```
1. Clean Database (your manual cleanup)
   ↓
2. Keep Stripe Test Data (no action needed)
   ↓  
3. Start Fresh Testing
   ↓
4. Monitor both systems independently
```

### Handle Orphaned Payment Intents
If you encounter "payment intent exists but no order found":

**Immediate solution:**
- Cancel the payment attempt
- Start fresh order
- Process new payment

**System handles it:**
```javascript
// Recovery gracefully fails with clear message
alert('No active tickets found to match this payment');
// User can start fresh order
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Stripe Test Mode is Forgiving
- **Multiple payment intents** for same amount are fine
- **Failed/incomplete payments** don't cause issues  
- **Orphaned payment intents** expire automatically
- **Fresh orders** work regardless of old data

### Database vs Stripe Relationship
```
Database: Order/ticket records (your control)
    ↕️
Stripe: Payment intent records (Stripe's control)
```

**After database cleanup:**
- Database: Clean slate ✅
- Stripe: Old test data (harmless) ✅  
- System: Works perfectly ✅

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**For your testing session:**

1. ✅ **Clean your database** (tickets, payments, etc.)
2. ✅ **Leave Stripe test data alone** (no action needed)
3. ✅ **Start fresh testing** with clean slate
4. ✅ **Monitor both systems** during testing

**Result**: Clean testing environment with proper separation of concerns!

## 🔍 Monitoring During Testing

### Check Stripe Dashboard
- Watch new payment intents being created
- Verify successful captures
- Monitor any failures

### Check Database
- Verify payments collection updates
- Confirm completed_orders creation
- Monitor ticket status progression

### Check Application Logs
- Payment recovery messages
- Stripe API responses  
- Database operation results

This approach gives you the cleanest testing environment while understanding how both systems work together!
