# PARC Restaurant System Testing Checklist

## üß™ Pre-Testing Setup

### Database State Verification
- [ ] **Transaction data cleared** (tickets, payments, completed_orders)
- [ ] **Seed data intact** (menu, staff, tables, inventory) 
- [ ] **Mixed table statuses** (available, cleaning, reserved, maintenance)
- [ ] **Staff accounts working** (server, manager, admin access)

### System Readiness
- [ ] **All critical collections exist** (`node test-collections.js`)
- [ ] **Stripe test mode configured** (test keys in .env)
- [ ] **Application loads without errors**
- [ ] **Authentication working** (login/logout flow)

## üéØ Core Workflow Testing

### 1. Basic Order Flow Test
**Goal**: Verify standard restaurant order ‚Üí payment workflow

- [ ] **Login as server** (e.g., marie.rousseau@parcbistro.com)
- [ ] **Select available table** from grid
- [ ] **Create new ticket** with customer count
- [ ] **Add 2-3 menu items** (different categories)
- [ ] **Add modifiers** to at least one item
- [ ] **Send orders to kitchen** (üìã Send Orders button)
- [ ] **Verify kitchen sees orders** (check kitchen dashboard)
- [ ] **Mark items as ready** (simulate kitchen completion)
- [ ] **Return to server dashboard**
- [ ] **Process card payment** (use 4242424242424242)
- [ ] **Complete transaction** with tip
- [ ] **Verify payment success** and table cleared
- [ ] **Check database records** (payments, completed_orders)

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Complete order ‚Üí payment ‚Üí completion cycle

### 2. Manager Override Test
**Goal**: Test force payment when kitchen forgets to update statuses

- [ ] **Login as manager/admin**
- [ ] **Select available table**
- [ ] **Create order** with multiple items

- [ ] **Verify payment buttons hidden** (items not ready)
- [ ] **See yellow warning checkbox** "‚ö†Ô∏è Force ready & enable payment"
- [ ] **Check override checkbox**
- [ ] **Verify items update to "ready"** (real-time)
- [ ] **Verify payment buttons appear**
- [ ] **Complete payment successfully**
- [ ] **Check kitchen dashboard** shows corrected statuses
- [ ] **Verify audit trail** in database

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Manager can override kitchen delays with full accountability

### 3. Payment Recovery Test
**Goal**: Test disconnected payment state recovery

- [ ] **Create order** and send to kitchen
- [ ] **Mark items ready** 
- [ ] **Start card payment** (authorize payment)
- [ ] **Simulate disconnection** (refresh page or navigate away)
- [ ] **Return to payment** (try to complete transaction)
- [ ] **Verify recovery system** finds correct order
- [ ] **See logs**: "üîç RECOVERY: Found X active tickets"
- [ ] **Complete payment** successfully
- [ ] **Verify no duplicate charges**

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ System recovers from disconnected payment states

### 4. Multi-Table Concurrent Test  
**Goal**: Test multiple orders without cross-contamination

- [ ] **Login as server**
- [ ] **Table 1**: Create order, send to kitchen
- [ ] **Table 2**: Create different order, send to kitchen  
- [ ] **Table 3**: Create third order, send to kitchen
- [ ] **Mark Table 2 items ready first**
- [ ] **Process Table 2 payment** 
- [ ] **Mark Table 1 items ready**
- [ ] **Process Table 1 payment**
- [ ] **Verify no cross-contamination** (correct items on correct tables)
- [ ] **Check payment records** match correct tickets
- [ ] **Complete Table 3** last

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Perfect isolation between concurrent orders

## üè¢ Realistic Restaurant Scenarios

### 5. Busy Night Simulation
**Goal**: Test system under realistic capacity constraints

- [ ] **Handle "no tables available" scenario**
- [ ] **Process payments** to free up tables
- [ ] **Verify table turnover** (cleaning ‚Üí available)

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ System handles capacity constraints gracefully

### 6. Maintenance & Edge Cases
**Goal**: Test system behavior with operational constraints

- [ ] **Attempt order** on reserved table (should block)
- [ ] **Try to process payment** with no items (should block)
- [ ] **Test with out-of-service tables** (should be unavailable)
- [ ] **Handle cleaning tables** (should show appropriate status)
- [ ] **Verify staff role permissions** (server vs manager access)

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Proper constraints and permission enforcement

## üí≥ Payment System Testing
