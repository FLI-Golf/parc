# PARC Portal POS System - Recommended Views

Based on the analysis of the PARC Portal codebase, I recommend implementing the following 4 key views for the POS system:

## 1. Server Dashboard View

This is the primary POS interface for servers to manage table service and orders.

### Key Features:
- **Table Management**: Visual representation of restaurant tables with status indicators
- **Order Taking**: Menu browsing with advanced filtering system (Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, Wine, Cocktails, etc.)
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated payment handling with Stripe
- **Shift Management**: Clock in/out functionality and shift status tracking
- **Cross-Section Help**: Ability to assist other sections when needed

### Implementation Components:
- Table status visualization with color-coded indicators
- Menu filtering system with collapsible interface
- Order customization with food/drink modifications
- Payment processing workflow (cash/card)
- Voice search integration for menu items

## 2. Kitchen Display System (KDS) View

This view provides real-time order tracking for kitchen staff.

### Key Features:
- **Order Queue**: Real-time display of incoming orders
- **Station-Based Organization**: Orders grouped by kitchen station (grill, cold station, fryer, etc.)
- **Timing Information**: Elapsed time and estimated preparation times
- **Order Status Management**: Mark items as "preparing" or "ready"
- **Urgency Indicators**: Visual cues for overdue or time-sensitive orders

### Implementation Components:
- Station-specific order lists
- Time tracking with visual indicators
- Order modification display
- Priority sorting for urgent orders

## 3. Bar Display View

Specialized view for bartenders to manage drink orders.

### Key Features:
- **Drink Order Queue**: Dedicated display for beverage orders
- **Preparation Tracking**: Timing and status updates for drinks
- **Special Instructions**: Display of customization requests
- **Integration with Kitchen Workflow**: Sync with main order system

### Implementation Components:
- Bar-specific order interface
- Drink modification handling
- Preparation status management

## 4. Manager Dashboard View

Administrative view for overseeing restaurant operations.

### Key Features:
- **Operational Overview**: Real-time metrics and alerts
- **Staff Management**: Shift scheduling and assignment
- **Inventory Tracking**: Stock levels and reorder alerts
- **Financial Insights**: Revenue tracking and cost analysis
- **Event Management**: Special events and reservation handling

### Implementation Components:
- Analytics dashboard with key metrics
- Staff scheduling interface
- Inventory management tools
- Financial reporting features

## Implementation Plan

Each view should be implemented as a separate Svelte component with the following considerations:

1. **Responsive Design**: All views should work on tablets and mobile devices
2. **Role-Based Access**: Proper authentication and authorization for each view
3. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
4. **Offline Capability**: Local storage for continued operation during network issues
5. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and efficient data fetching

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- **Backend**: PocketBase (BaaS)
- **Database**: SQLite via PocketBase
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration
- **Deployment**: Netlify for frontend, Fly.io for PocketBase

## Next Steps

1. Create component structure for each view
2. Implement authentication and role-based access
3. Develop core functionality for each view
4. Integrate with PocketBase backend
5. Test across different user roles
6. Optimize for performance and usability
